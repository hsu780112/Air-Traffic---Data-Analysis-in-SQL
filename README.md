# Air-Traffic-Analysis
This project aims to support investment decisions for BrainStation Mutual Fundâ€™s potential stake in one of three major airline stocks. Using detailed flight and airport data, we will address specific business questions to uncover actionable insights into the airlines' performance, efficiency, and operational strengths. Our findings will offer clear, data-backed guidance to inform the fund managers' investment choices.

Alongside generating meaningful insights, this analysis will demonstrate advanced SQL skills, showcasing efficient data handling, querying, and analysis.
